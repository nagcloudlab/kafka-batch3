1. Scan Through Keys and Filter by Value (Using Lua Script or Application Logic):
You can scan through the keys and fetch their values to find keys matching a specific value. This is generally done using the SCAN command combined with GET in your application code or with a Lua script for performance.

Example:
lua
Copy code
local result = {}
local cursor = "0"
repeat
    local scanResult = redis.call("SCAN", cursor, "MATCH", "your_key_pattern:*")
    cursor = scanResult[1]
    for _, key in ipairs(scanResult[2]) do
        local value = redis.call("GET", key)
        if value == "desired_value" then
            table.insert(result, key)
        end
    end
until cursor == "0"
return result


2. Secondary Indexes:
You can maintain secondary indexes manually. For example, whenever you set a value for a key, you also store the key in a set where the value is the set name. This way, you can easily retrieve keys based on their values.
Example:
redis
Copy code
SET key1 "value1"
SADD value1_keys "key1"

SET key2 "value1"
SADD value1_keys "key2"

SADD value2_keys "key3"

SMEMBERS value1_keys  # returns key1, key2


3. Using RedisJSON Module:
If your values are JSON objects, you can use the RedisJSON module which supports querying based on values inside JSON objects.
Example:
redis
Copy code
JSON.SET key1 . '{"name": "John", "age": 30}'
JSON.SET key2 . '{"name": "Doe", "age": 25}'

JSON.GET key1 .name  # returns "John"


4. Use of Hashes:
If your values are stored in Redis hashes, you can iterate over the fields and filter by value.
Example:
redis
Copy code
HSET myhash key1 "value1"
HSET myhash key2 "value2"
HSET myhash key3 "value1"

HSCAN myhash 0 MATCH * COUNT 10
Each method has its trade-offs in terms of performance and complexity, so you should choose the one that best fits your use case.
