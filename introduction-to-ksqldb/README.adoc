This repository contains two (TWO!) demos that you can use to explore ksqlDB. 

* link:demo_introduction_to_ksqldb_01.adoc[Demo 01] is based on the movement of people
** ðŸŽ¥ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mGBxG2NhVQ[Recording]

* link:demo_introduction_to_ksqldb_02.adoc[Demo 02] uses generated order data

Both are run using the same Docker Compose file. See each demo script (linked above) for how to run them.
